Koenji is less well-known than Shimokitazawa however so the streets will be quieter and importantly the vintage clothes will be cheaper. As vintage shopping has become trendy so have the prices gone up, the best shop to visit (and this is a chain so you can them all over Japan) is called second street which has a huge selection of clothes and is the cheapest store.",
